# Machine-Learning-Project-Failure-Modes

## I created this project to practice some data science skills.

### Using concepts:

- Data analysis
- PCA
- Statistical analysis
- Decision trees
- Neural networks

### Technology:

- Colab
- Sklearn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenML

The data is a synthetic set of heavy machinery with varying failure modes. It is almost entirely numerical.
